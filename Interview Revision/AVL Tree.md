AN AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. Where the difference between heights of the left and right subtrees cor any node cannot be more than one. Known as the balance factor.

O(log n) - search, insert, delete

For any node the height of its two subtrees differ by at most 1.

Balance factor = height of left - height of right

Height is the measure from the bottom to the node.

More balanced then Red-black but slower insertions and deletions.
