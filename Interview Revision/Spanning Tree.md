A spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all the vertices of the supergraph.

A graph that is not connected will not contain a spanning tree.

Minimum spanning tree or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible edge weight. E.g. the spanning tree that uses the least weight in edges to connect the graph.

MST is solved by using Union-Find.
